In order to Install Sensu Opensource, you just need to install the 3 RPMs' provided in the

rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 directory:

sensu-go-agent		(Agent to run checks on host)
sensu-go-backend	(Sensu Go Backend Server)
sensu-go-cli		(Command Line Interface to configure Sensu)

You can read the official Install docs here:
https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/6.1/operations/deploy-sensu/install-sensu/

After the 3 packages have been installed onto host, You will need to do the following:

#1) Start sensu-backend
systemctl start sensu-backend

#2) Initialize Backend with Initial Username/password
export SENSU_BACKEND_CLUSTER_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export SENSU_BACKEND_CLUSTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=somepassword
sensu-backend init

#3) Configure the Sensu CLI to talk to Backend, this assumes you running CLI on the same host as the backend, you can obviously use a dedicated/jumphost to talk to the backend.
sensuctl configure -n \
--username 'YOUR_USERNAME' \
--password 'YOUR_PASSWORD' \
--namespace default \
--url 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'

#4) Test Sensu is working, it will return just a line of headers with no data (this is expected as it is new install)
sensuctl event list
sensuctl entity list

Now you are ready to start deploying checks, handlers, filters, etc.
