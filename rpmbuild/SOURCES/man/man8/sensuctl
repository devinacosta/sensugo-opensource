.SH FIRST TIME SETUP
To set up sensuctl, run sensuctl configure to log in to sensuctl and connect to the Sensu backend:

.B sensuctl configure

When prompted, type the Sensu backend URL and your Sensu access credentials.

 Sensu Backend URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080 
 Username: YOUR_USERNAME 
 Password: YOUR_PASSWORD
 Namespace: default 
 Preferred output format: tabular 
.SH SENSU BACKEND URL
The Sensu backend URL is the HTTP or HTTPS URL where sensuctl can connect to the Sensu backend server. The default URL is http://127.0.0.1:8080.

To connect to a Sensu cluster, connect sensuctl to any single backend in the cluster. For information about configuring the Sensu backend URL, see the backend reference.
.SH USERNAME,PASSWORD,NAMESPACE
During the Sensu backend installation process, you create an administrator username and password and a default namespace.

Your ability to get, list, create, update, and delete resources with sensuctl depends on the permissions assigned to your Sensu user. For more information about configuring Sensu access control, see the RBAC reference.

NOTE: For a new installation, you can set administrator credentials with environment variables during initialization. If you are using Docker and you do not include the environment variables to set administrator credentials, the backend will initialize with the default username (admin) and password (P@ssw0rd!).

.B Change admin user’s password

After you have installed and configured sensuctl, you can change the admin user’s password. Run:

.B sensuctl user change-password --interactive
